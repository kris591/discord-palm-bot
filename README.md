![Bot Demo](demo.jpg)

A very simple [Discord](https://discord.com) bot that integrates with [Google's PaLM API](https://developers.generativeai.google/) using the [PaLM 2 model](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) through MakerSuite to provide an ongoing chat. It utilizes artificial intelligence to generate responses and engage in conversations.

## ‚ú® Features

-   Chat with the PaLM API while saving the context of the conversation.
-   Simply prefix your prompt with `$ ` to have the bot respond to you in an ongoing chat.
-   The bot persists the conversation context in a local `messages.txt` file so it can continue the conversation even if you restart the bot.
-   Generate text, code, and more with the PaLM API!

This Discord bot is built with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## üí° Setup Tips

You'll need access to the PaLM API which you can get by [joining the developer preview waitlist](https://developers.generativeai.google/) and receiving access through MakerSuite.

You'll also need to [set up a Discord bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) and a Discord bot with the following:

-   Scopes
    -   applications.commands
    -   bot
-   Permissions
    -   Send Messages
    -   Read Messages/View Channels
-   Intents
    -   Message Content Intent

Your resulting invite link should look similar to this:

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<bot-client-id>&permissions=3072&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

Add your PaLM API key and Discord bot token to the same `.env` file, which you can do by replacing the values in the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file and renaming the file to `.env`.

> Remember to keep your API keys secret!

You can then install the necessary packages (preferably in [a virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)) with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run the bot with `python bot.py`.
