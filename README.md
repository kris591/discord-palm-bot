![Bot Demo](demo.jpg)

A very simple [Discord](https://discord.com) bot that integrates with [Google's PaLM API](https://developers.generativeai.google/) using the [PaLM 2 model](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) through MakerSuite to provide an ongoing chat. It utilizes artificial intelligence to generate responses and engage in conversations.

## ‚ú® Features

- Chat with the PaLM API while saving the context of the conversation.
- Simply prefix your prompt with `$ ` to have the bot respond to you in an ongoing chat.
- The bot persists the conversation context in a local `messages.txt` file so it can continue the conversation even if you restart the bot.
- Generate text, code, and more with the PaLM API!

This Discord bot is built with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## üí° Setup Tips

You'll need access to the PaLM API which you can get by [joining the developer preview waitlist](https://developers.generativeai.google/) and receiving access through MakerSuite. Once you get access, generate an API key and save it in a `.env` file. You'll also need to [set up a Discord bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), make sure you enable the message content intent, and add your Discord bot token to the same `.env` file. You can easily do this by replacing the values in the `.env.example` file and renaming the file to `.env`.

> Remember to keep your API keys secret!

You can then install the necessary packages (preferably in [a virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)) with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run the bot with `python bot.py`.
